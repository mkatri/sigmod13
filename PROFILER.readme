to build with profiler support
use:
make -f Makefile.profile
or 
copy Makefile.profile to Makefile

to disable profiler support
use
make -f Makefile.normal
or copy Makefile.normal to Makefile

run the test as usual, if the library was built with profiler enabled, it'll ouput a binary file called "gmon.out"

to generate human readable analysis file, use:
gprof bin/ourtestdriver gmon.out > analysis.txt
